    <h2>About Me</h2>
    <p>I am an Information Technology student with a strong interest in web development, software engineering, and emerging technologies. 
        I enjoy building clean, responsive, and user-friendly websites using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. 
        Along with frontend development, I have a solid foundation in programming languages such as Java and C++, which helps me understand problem-solving and application logic effectively.
<br>
I am continuously learning new technologies and improving my skills by working on real-world projects, website clones, and mini applications. My goal is to grow as a full-stack developer and contribute to innovative and impactful software solutions while gaining hands-on industry experience.</p>
